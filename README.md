UITextFieldLimit
================

This sub-class of the UITextField adds a text length limit. It also shows the number of left characters inside the TextField.
Use it for multiple TextFields, the number of left characters will hidden when the user ends the editing.

NO LICENCE! WOHOOO! It's developed by Jonathan Gurebo! and it means that you can do whatever you like to do.
Sell it, modify it, distribute it, copy it, resell it, patent it. Do what-ever you like. But you can give me credit if you like to ;) OPTIONAL
